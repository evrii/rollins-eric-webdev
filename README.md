# Webdev Information

Hello there!

My name is Eric Rollins. I am part time student at Northeastern University, and I am currently going for my M.S. in Computer Science. I work full time at the Department of Justice as a Computer Scientist. I work primarily to make interfaces for databases. My most recent personal project has been working on developing a website for my wedding this summer.

This repository is for my assignments in Professor Jose Annunziato's Summer 1 session of CS 5610: Web Development. This repository will serve both as a place to host the six assignments for this course but also for the final project. I am hoping to do some work with the [Open Education API](https://openonderwijsapi.nl/en/), but more on that later!

In case you are curious about following my progress through this course, check out some of my links below:
